E-Portfolio Checklist:

1) Put my chatbot application into my work, it shows
my experience using python

2) Experiment with nmap on my own home network, try and 
explore more into the ins and outs of the system. Not just that
maybe even use dads garage for this???

3) Place all my hand written notes onto my ipad
just purely for better visuals.

4) Make summary notes on all of the extra reading activites

5) Add my notes into each folder so that my notes per week are nicely organised

6) make sure to make a note at the top of each code which exercises each code covers
